# Ayman Osman, Bioinformatician
Hi there! I’m Ayman Osman, a bioinformatician specializing in multi-omics research. My work focuses on integrating various omics data to uncover insights into complex biological systems, particularly in the context of cancer research. I have extensive experience in analyzing epigenomic, proteomic, and gene expression data analysis, utilizing both command line tools and R/Bioconductor for my analyses.

## Projects
- [RNAseq Differential Expression Analysis Shiny App](https://github.com/osman12345/RNAseq_analysis) This Shiny app performs RNAseq differential expression analysis using edgeR and limma. It allows users to upload count data and sample metadata, choose species, and then run the analysis. The app generates diagnostic plots and tables for visualization and lets users download the differential expression results.

- [DNA to Protein Translation Tool](https://github.com/osman12345/DNA-to-Protein-Translation-Tool)

  The DNA to Protein Translation Tool is a simple web-based application that translates a given DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequences.
- [Multi-Omics Data Integration](https://github.com/osman12345/Multi-Omics-Data-Integration): Leading a project that integrates genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomics data to identify biomarkers and therapeutic targets in heart diseases. Developing analysis pipelines using bash and R/Bioconductor packages.
- [ChIP-Seq Data Analysis](https://github.com/osman12345/ChIP-Seq-Data-Analysis):
